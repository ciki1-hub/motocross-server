# Free Alternatives for Motocross Streaming Server

If you prefer to avoid providing credit card information to Render, here are some alternative options for hosting your streaming server:

## 1. Replit

Replit offers a free tier that can host Node.js applications without requiring a credit card:

- Create a free Replit account
- Import the API server portion of your code (the Node.js server)
- For the RTMP server, you'd need a separate solution as mentioned below

## 2. Self-Hosted RTMP Server Options

The RTMP streaming server is more resource-intensive and typically requires a paid plan. Alternative approaches:

### Option A: Single-Server Version (More Limited)
You can modify the API server to handle both API calls and a lightweight version of streaming, though with limited capacity:

```javascript
// Add to your existing Express server
const NodeMediaServer = require('node-media-server');

const config = {
  rtmp: {
    port: 1935,
    chunk_size: 60000,
    gop_cache: true,
    ping: 30,
    ping_timeout: 60
  },
  http: {
    port: 8000,
    allow_origin: '*'
  }
};

const nms = new NodeMediaServer(config);
nms.run();
```

### Option B: Free RTMP Proxies
Some services offer free tiers that can relay RTMP streams:

- Castr.io (has a limited free tier)
- Owncast (open source, can be self-hosted)

## 3. Railway.app

Railway.app offers a free tier with $5 of free credits per month without requiring a credit card:

- Deploy both the API server and a lightweight RTMP server
- Limited monthly usage but sufficient for testing

## 4. Fly.io

Fly.io offers a generous free tier without requiring a credit card upfront:

- Supports Docker containers (good for your RTMP server)
- Free tier includes 3 shared-cpu VMs

## Important Considerations

For any free tier service:

1. **Limited Resources**: Free tiers typically have CPU/RAM limitations that may affect streaming quality
2. **Idle Shutdown**: Many free services shut down after periods of inactivity
3. **Bandwidth Limitations**: Most free tiers have monthly bandwidth caps

For a production-quality motocross streaming app, you may eventually need to consider a paid service, but these options will help you get started without a credit card.
